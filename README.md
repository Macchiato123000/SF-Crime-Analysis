# Spatial and time series analysis on SF crime data and modeling

### Data
I downloaded dataset [Police_Department_Incident_Reports__Historical_2003_to_May_2018.csv] (https://data.sfgov.org/api/views/tmnf-yvry/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD). 
At first I use the small data for code debug and then load the large dataset above to do real analysis.

### Work
SF crime analysis based on dataset from SFPD. Using spark to do some EDA, spatial analysis, implementing time series and applying ARIMA model.

### Results
Data preprocessing, analysis, and ARIMA modeling can be found in [Spark_SF_Crime.ipynb] and [SF_crime_analysis.ipynb].
