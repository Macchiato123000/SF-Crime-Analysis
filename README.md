# Spatial and time series analysis on SF crime data and modeling

### Data
I downloaded dataset [Police_Department_Incident_Reports__Historical_2003_to_May_2018.csv] (https://data.sfgov.org/api/views/tmnf-yvry/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD). 

### Work
SF crime analysis based on dataset from SFPD. Using spark to do some spatial analysis, implementing time series and applying ARIMA model.

### Results
Data processing, analysis, and ARIMA modeling can be found in [Spark_SF_Crime.ipynb] and [SF_crime_analysis.ipynb].
